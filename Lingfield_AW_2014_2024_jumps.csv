They interviewed the rider and the trainers representative. They also received observations from the Handicapper and a report from the Veterinary Officer who confirmed that a post-race examination of the filly failed to reveal any abnormalities. The rider stated his instructions were to try and settle the filly halfway down the field and go down the inner and to make his run. He added that he had found himself further back than he would have liked and that the filly had run keenly to begin with. The filly had got hampered approximately 4 furlongs out and as a consequence he had to switch outside to make his run and the filly had then picked up after entering the home straight. The trainers representative confirmed that these were the instructions given and that she was satisfied with the ride. Having heard their evidence and viewed recordings of the race the Stewards noted their explanations.)(op 8/1)
